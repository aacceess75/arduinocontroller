Introduction
============

This is a simple module to control an Arduino UNO board 
directly connected to the USB port.

To-Do
=====

Support more board models (Arduino Mega is easy to add, 
but I don't have one to test).

Add interrupt-like actions on pin changes to trigger 
OpenERP asctions or views.
